  <h1>What's Offside?</h1>
  <div class="intro-text">
    <p>If you&rsquo;re watching the World Cup this month, you&rsquo;ll certainly encounter the offside rule a few times. What's &ldquo;offside&rdquo; mean?</p>
    <p>The offside rule in <a href="#" id="soccer_link" class="interactive-link"><span class="soccer">soccer</span></a> is mostly about passing: in a nutshell, it says you can&rsquo;t pass the ball ahead of the defense. More specifically, it says you cannot receive the ball or interfere with play if you are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>in the opposing team's half,</li>
      <li>closer to the opposing team's goal line than the ball is, and</li>
      <li>closer to the opposing team's goal line than all but one defender.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What's that look like?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-text">
    <p class="section">
      Here's a <span class="soccer">soccer</span> pitch. The attacking side is in white, the defense in blue. You can <span class="click">click</span> to <a href="#" id="offside_toggle" class="interactive-link" data-show-text="show the offside area" data-hide-text="hide the offside area">see the offside area</a>&mdash;the part of the pitch where an attacking player would be offside.
    </p>
    <p class="section">
      On a <a href="#" class="event-changer interactive-link" data-state="normal_attack" data-event="starting_position">normal attack</a>, some attacking players will try to get forward, close to the goal, so they can score more easily.
    </p>
    <p class="section">
      However, if an attacking player gets <a href="#" class="interactive-link event-changer" data-state="normal_attack" data-event="over_forward">too far forward</a>, they'll go offside, and if the ball is then passed to them, play will stop and the defending team gets the ball.
    </p>
    <p class="section">
      But what matters is where the players are when the pass starts, not when they pick up the ball.
